gameHeadingHelperText=This Program simulates the 7-11 Doubles drinking game.
gameSummaryHelperText=The object of the game is to make other players drink their favorite beverage. Each\n player takes turns rooling a pair of dice. A winning rool of the dice occurs if the total of\n the dice is 7 or 11, or the dice show doubles (1-1,2-2,etc.) When the current player\n rolls a winning combination, they choose some other player to drink their beverage\n and the current player gets to roll again. Any other combination is a losing roll and\n the current player's turn is over and the dice are passed to the next player.If the\n current player rolls a losing combination and any other player has not finished\n drinking, the current player ignores the losing rool and rolls again. Winning rolls are\n treated as above.It is possible for more than one other player to be drinking at the\n same time. In this simulation, the game can begin after two players have joined. The\n game ends when only one player is left. A player will leave the game after being made\n to drink a specified number of drinks. If the player has drinks remaining, they must\n finish them, but should not be assigned any more drinks.
